Script-based agent workflows with shared orchestration framework.

## MANDATORY: Read Before Modifying

**STOP. Before editing ANY Python file in `skills/scripts/`, you MUST read `README.md`.**

The README defines:

- File section ordering (SHARED PROMPTS -> CONFIGURATION -> MESSAGE TEMPLATES -> MESSAGE BUILDERS -> WORKFLOW)
- Step-delimited prompt organization within MESSAGE TEMPLATES
- Naming conventions for prompt constants (`[PHASE]_[TYPE]`)
- Patterns for dispatch prompts (static templates vs builder functions)
- Anti-patterns to avoid (action factories, forward references)

Failure to follow these patterns creates technical debt and inconsistency across skills. The patterns exist because they solve real problems with prompt readability and maintenance.

**Read `README.md` now if you haven't already.**

## Script Invocation

All Python skill scripts are invoked as modules from `scripts/`:

<invoke working-dir=".claude/skills/scripts" cmd="python3 -m skills.<skill_name>.<module> --step 1" />

Example:

<invoke working-dir=".claude/skills/scripts" cmd="python3 -m skills.problem_analysis.analyze --step 1" />
