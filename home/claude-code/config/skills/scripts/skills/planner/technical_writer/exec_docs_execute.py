"""Impl docs execution - post-implementation documentation workflow.

6-step workflow for technical-writer sub-agent:
  1. Task Description (POST_IMPL type, deliverables)
  2. Extract Plan Information (IK, modified files, milestones)
  3. CLAUDE.md Index Format (tabular format rules)
  4. README.md Creation (creation criteria, IK mapping)
  5. Verify Transcribed Comments (spot-check comment transcription)
  6. Output Format (documentation report)

This is the EXECUTE script for first-time post-impl documentation.
For QR fix mode, see exec_docs_qr_fix.py.
Router (exec_docs.py) dispatches to appropriate script.
