Simplified AST with only the nodes actually used by skills:
- TextNode: Plain text content
- CodeNode: Code blocks with optional language
- ElementNode: Generic XML element (used via W.el())

All specialized nodes (HeaderNode, ActionsNode, etc.) were removed because
skills use W.el("tag_name", ...) pattern exclusively.
