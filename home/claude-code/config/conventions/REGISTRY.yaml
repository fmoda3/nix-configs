# Role-Convention Registry
# CI validates actual get_convention() calls match these declarations
#
# Structure per role:
#   receives: list of conventions this role loads
#   phase_specific: per-phase convention overrides
#   mode_specific: per-mode convention overrides (design vs code)
#   rationale: explanation for roles with empty receives
