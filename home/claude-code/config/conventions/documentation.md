# Documentation Conventions

This is the authoritative documentation conventions file. All code-adjacent
documentation (CLAUDE.md, README.md) must follow these principles.

## Core Principles

**Self-contained documentation**: All code-adjacent documentation (CLAUDE.md,
README.md) must be self-contained. Do NOT reference external authoritative
sources (doc/ directories, wikis, external documentation). If knowledge exists
in an authoritative source, it must be summarized locally. Duplication is
acceptable; the maintenance burden is the cost of locality.

**CLAUDE.md = pure index**: CLAUDE.md files are navigation aids only. They
contain WHAT is in the directory and WHEN to read each file. All explanatory
content (architecture, decisions, invariants) belongs in README.md.

**README.md = invisible knowledge**: README.md files capture knowledge NOT
visible from reading source code. If ANY invisible knowledge exists for a
directory, README.md is required.

## CLAUDE.md Format Specification

### Index Format

Use tabular format with What and When columns:

```markdown
## Files

| File        | What                           | When to read                              |
| ----------- | ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| `cache.rs`  | LRU cache with O(1) operations | Implementing caching, debugging evictions |
| `errors.rs` | Error types and Result aliases | Adding error variants, handling failures  |

## Subdirectories

| Directory   | What                          | When to read                              |
| ----------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `config/`   | Runtime configuration loading | Adding config options, modifying defaults |
| `handlers/` | HTTP request handlers         | Adding endpoints, modifying request flow  |
```

### Column Guidelines

- **File/Directory**: Use backticks around names: `cache.rs`, `config/`
- **What**: Factual description of contents (nouns, not actions)
- **When to read**: Task-oriented triggers using action verbs (implementing,
  debugging, modifying, adding, understanding)
- At least one column must have content; empty cells use `-`

### Trigger Quality Test

Given task "add a new validation rule", can an LLM scan the "When to read"
column and identify the right file?

### Generated and Vendored Code

CLAUDE.md MUST flag files/directories that should not be manually edited:

| Directory      | What                              | When to read        |
| -------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| `proto/gen/`   | Generated from proto/. Run `make` | Never edit directly |
| `vendor/`      | Vendored deps, upstream: go.mod   | Never edit directly |
| `third_party/` | Copied from github.com/foo v1.2.3 | Never edit directly |

The "When to read" column should indicate these are not editable. Include
regeneration commands in the "What" column or in a dedicated Regenerate section.

This prevents LLMs from wasting effort analyzing or "improving" auto-generated
code, and prevents edits that will be overwritten or cause merge conflicts.

See also: conventions/code-quality/baseline.md "Generated and Vendored Code Awareness".

### ROOT vs SUBDIRECTORY CLAUDE.md

**ROOT CLAUDE.md:**

```markdown
# [Project Name]

[One sentence: what this is]

## Files

| File | What | When to read |
| ---- | ---- | ------------ |

## Subdirectories

| Directory | What | When to read |
| --------- | ---- | ------------ |

## Build

[Copy-pasteable command]

## Test

[Copy-pasteable command]

## Development

[Setup instructions, environment requirements, workflow notes]
```

**SUBDIRECTORY CLAUDE.md:**

```markdown
# [directory-name]/

## Files

| File | What | When to read |
| ---- | ---- | ------------ |

## Subdirectories

| Directory | What | When to read |
| --------- | ---- | ------------ |
```

**Critical constraint:** CLAUDE.md files are navigation aids, not explanatory
documents. They contain:

- File/directory index (REQUIRED): tabular format with What/When columns
- One-sentence overview (OPTIONAL): what this directory is
- Operational sections (OPTIONAL): Build, Test, Regenerate, Deploy, or similar
  commands specific to this directory's artifacts

They do NOT contain:

- Architectural explanations (-> README.md)
- Design decisions or rationale (-> README.md)
- Invariants or constraints (-> README.md)
- Multi-paragraph prose (-> README.md)

Operational sections must be copy-pasteable commands with minimal context, not
explanatory prose about why the build works a certain way.

## README.md Specification

### Creation Criteria (Invisible Knowledge Test)

Create README.md when the directory contains ANY invisible knowledge --
knowledge NOT visible from reading the code:

- Planning decisions (from Decision Log during implementation)
- Business context (why the product works this way)
- Architectural rationale (why this structure)
- Trade-offs made (what was sacrificed for what)
- Invariants (rules that must hold but aren't in types)
- Historical context (why not alternatives)
- Performance characteristics (non-obvious efficiency properties)
- Multiple components interact through non-obvious contracts
- The directory's structure encodes domain knowledge
- Failure modes or edge cases aren't apparent from reading individual files
- "Rules" developers must follow that aren't enforced by compiler/linter

**README.md is required if ANY of the above exist.** The trigger is semantic
(presence of invisible knowledge), not structural (file count, complexity).

**DO NOT create README.md when:**

- The directory is purely organizational with no decisions behind its structure
- All knowledge is visible from reading source code
- You'd only be restating what code already shows

### Content Test

For each sentence in README.md, ask: "Could a developer learn this by reading
the source files?"

- If YES: delete the sentence
- If NO: keep it

README.md earns its tokens by providing INVISIBLE knowledge: the reasoning
behind the code, not descriptions of the code.

### README.md Structure

```markdown
# [Component Name]

## Overview

[One paragraph: what problem this solves, high-level approach]

## Architecture

[How sub-components interact; data flow; key abstractions]

## Design Decisions

[Tradeoffs made and why; alternatives considered]

## Invariants

[Rules that must be maintained; constraints not enforced by code]
```

## Architecture Documentation

For cross-cutting concerns and system-wide relationships that span multiple
directories, create dedicated architecture documentation.

### Structure

```markdown
# Architecture: [System/Feature Name]

## Overview

[One paragraph: problem and high-level approach]

## Components

[Each component with its single responsibility and boundaries]

## Data Flow

[Critical paths - prefer diagrams for complex flows]

## Design Decisions

[Key tradeoffs and rationale]

## Boundaries

[What this system does NOT do; where responsibility ends]
```

### Quality Standard

Components must explain relationships, not just list responsibilities.

Wrong -- lists without relationships:

```markdown
## Components

- UserService: Handles user operations
- AuthService: Handles authentication
- Database: Stores data
```

Right -- explains boundaries and flow:

```markdown
## Components

- UserService: User CRUD only. Delegates auth to AuthService. Never queries auth
  state directly.
- AuthService: Token validation, session management. Stateless; all state in
  Redis.
- PostgreSQL: Source of truth for user data. AuthService has no direct access.

Flow: Request -> AuthService (validate) -> UserService (logic) -> Database
```

Prefer diagrams over prose for relationships.

## In-Code Documentation

Code-level documentation captures knowledge at the point where it is most useful.
The principle: knowledge belongs as close as possible to the code it describes.
Cross-cutting knowledge that cannot be localized belongs in README.md.

### Tier 1: Inline Comments

Above statements or expressions where the choice is non-obvious.

Document *why* this approach, never *what* the code does. The reader can see what
the code does: they cannot see why it was chosen over alternatives.

Good:

```python
# Polling: 30% webhook delivery failures observed in production
result = poll_endpoint(url, interval=30)

# Mutex-free: single-writer guarantee from caller contract
counter.fetch_add(1, Ordering::Relaxed)
```

Bad:

```python
# Poll the endpoint
result = poll_endpoint(url, interval=30)

# Increment the counter
counter.fetch_add(1, Ordering::Relaxed)
```

When a decision log entry exists, reference it: `# DL-003: Polling over webhooks`

### Tier 2: Function-Level Explanation Blocks

Near the top of non-trivial functions (after signature, before body logic).
Required when a function has >3 distinct transformation steps, coordinates
multiple subsystems, or implements a non-obvious algorithm.

Content: what the function does, how it does it, how it fits in the overall
architecture, what problem it solves.

```python
def reconcile_state(local, remote):
    # Reconciles local state against remote source of truth. Operates in
    # three phases:
    # 1. Diff local vs remote to find divergent keys
    # 2. For each divergence, apply conflict resolution (remote wins)
    # 3. Write merged state back to local store
    #
    # Called by the sync loop after each heartbeat. Remote state is
    # authoritative -- local is a cache that may lag behind.
    ...
```

Skip for CRUD operations and standard patterns where the code speaks for itself.

### Tier 3: Docstrings

**Private functions**: One-line summary + trigger clause (when to call).

```python
def _normalize_key(k):
    """Strip whitespace and lowercase. Use before cache lookup."""
```

**Public functions**: Summary + trigger clause + parameter semantics + example.
Optimized for LLM consumption -- trigger clauses and examples enable accurate
tool selection.

```python
def validate_config(path, strict=False):
    """Validate configuration file against schema.

    Use when loading user-provided config at startup or after hot-reload.
    In strict mode, unknown keys are errors; otherwise warnings.

    Args:
        path: Absolute path to YAML config file.
        strict: Treat unknown keys as errors.

    Returns:
        Validated Config object.

    Example:
        cfg = validate_config("/etc/app/config.yaml", strict=True)
    """
```

### Tier 4: Module Documentation

Top-of-file comment or module docstring. Documents what the module contains and
why it exists as a separate unit.

```python
"""Rate limiting using sliding window counters.

Provides per-client rate limiting for the API gateway. Sliding window
chosen over fixed window to prevent burst-at-boundary attacks (DL-007).
Token bucket rejected: memory overhead per client unacceptable at
projected scale (>100k concurrent clients).
"""
```

### Tier 5: Invisible Knowledge Placement

Invisible knowledge is knowledge not visible from reading the code: business
context, architectural rationale, tradeoffs, constraints, rejected alternatives.

**Placement hierarchy** (closest viable location wins):

1. **Inline comment**: When knowledge applies to a specific statement
2. **Function-level block**: When knowledge applies to an entire function's
   approach or algorithm
3. **Module docstring**: When knowledge applies to why this module exists or
   its overall design
4. **README.md**: When knowledge is cross-cutting (spans multiple files/modules)
   or cannot be localized to a single code point

What is NOT acceptable: invisible knowledge captured only in planning artifacts
(decision logs, plan documents, conversation history) that are not carried
forward into the codebase. Every decision, constraint, and tradeoff must land
in code or README.md.

### Priority Order

When deciding what to document, prioritize by uncertainty:

| Priority | Code Pattern                 | WHY Question           |
| -------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| HIGH     | Multiple valid approaches    | Why this approach?     |
| HIGH     | Thresholds, timeouts, limits | Why these values?      |
| HIGH     | Error handling paths         | Recovery strategy?     |
| HIGH     | External system interactions | What assumptions?      |
| MEDIUM   | Non-standard pattern usage   | Why deviate from norm? |
| MEDIUM   | Performance-critical paths   | Why this optimization? |
| LOW      | Boilerplate/established      | Skip unless unusual    |
| LOW      | Simple CRUD operations       | Skip unless unusual    |
